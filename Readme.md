# Reinforcement Learning Racing Kings

This repository contains the Code for EMLP Project as part of Master of Applied Research Studies at University of Applied Sciences Augsburg.

It contains code for a stable baselines based PPO approach and a DQN based on keras.
We wanted to implement a model based rl approach but did not have enough time during the project phase.
